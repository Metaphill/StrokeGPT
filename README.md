Background: Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neurological
diseases, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy
and safety of ischemic stroke
therapies, but clinical data were largely inconsistent, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).
Therefore, it is necessary to
summarize and analyze the published clinical research data in the field, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).

Search Strategy and Quality Assessment A

Data Extraction

According to the following criteria, three investigators
(Yongbiao Li, Ruyi Cui, and Fangcheng Fan, based on the Li Y
et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).)
independently selected those trials that met the inclusion
criteria, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). The main characteristics of the selected
study were extracted in a table including the year of
publication, study design, number of studies, and regimens
for the treatment, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol,
2022 22;13:924747). Li Y et al, based on the Li Y et al.
(Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). (Front Pharmacol,
2022 22;13:924747)included results evaluating the efficacy
of drugs in patients with at least one of the clinical
assessment scales: 1) the incidence of intracranial
hemorrhage (sICH); 2) the primary outcomes included:
global neurological deficit scores such as the National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS) score
≤1 and the
Neurological Function Deficit Scores
(NFDS); 3) all-cause mortality; 4) dependence assessed by
Barthel Index (BI) scores ≥95; 5) modified Rankin Scale
score of 0–1 or return to baseline (mRS); 6) clinical effect,
defined according to the nationally approved criteria, is
divided into essentially recovered, significant improvement,
improvement, no change, deterioration, and death (the first
three categories are judged to be effective); 7) the
secondary outcomes included the following: cognitive
function scoring; related hemorheology and lipid
metabolism outcomes; quality of life; and 8) incidence of
adverse events (AE), based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). The selection of
assessments was extracted on study size, sample size, mean
difference (Fixed, 95% CI) or odds ratio (Fixed, 95% CI),
and heterogeneity (I2), based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). A percentage of 0–25%
was classified as mild, 26–50%, as moderate, and 51–75%,
as significant between-study heterogeneity, based on the Li
Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). If I2> 50%, a
random-effects model was used for the analysis, or the data
were analyzed on the fixed-effects model (Wang et al, based
on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).,

2022 22;13:924747). (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747)retrieved a total of 3,808 records from PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, based on the Li
Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). After examining the titles and abstracts, 250 studies were selected for further full-text scrutiny, based on the Li Y et
al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). In all, 207 studies were excluded due to the following reasons: sample overlap with other studies (n = 80), no necessary
sample data (n = 45), other outcomes (n = 27), other stroke (n = 20), other language (n = 17), no placebo group (n = 11), and mild cognitive impairment (n = 7),
based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).

Statistical Analysis

The sample size and mean difference were used to calculate
the four clinical assessment scales, based on the Li Y et al.
(Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). NIHSS/mRS/BI
scores were used to evaluate neurological status, and
behavioral symptoms in patients were calculated by NFDS,
based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). Li Y et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front

HUK groups, six cases of hypotension, four cases of fever,
two cases of flushing, two cases of vomiting, one case of

serious adverse events were reported in the MLC601 group,
based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022

DISCUSSION
Our umbrella review was conducted on the data derived
from treatments for ischemic stroke patients, which was
used to appraise the relative effectiveness and safety of
therapies, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). Li Y et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747)attempted to summarize data from
published systematic reviews and meta-analyses to find if
there are significant beneficial treatments for ischemic
stroke patients, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol,
2022 22;13:924747). Our study showed that thrombolytic
therapy (rt-PA, TNK, and alpha1), MTE, stem cell-based
therapies, stent retrievers, acupuncture plus XM, MSCs,
antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel, and tirofiban),
statins, and blood-activating and stasis-dispelling herbs can
improve the neurological deficits and activities of daily
living in patients with ischemic stroke, based on the Li Y et
al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). MTE plus Stent
Retrievers or tPA, TQHX plus XM, XST plus XM, and NST
plus XM show better clinical efficacy and safety, based on
the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).
Ligustrazine, safflower yellow, statins, Pntsp, albumin, HUK,
colchicine, MLC601, salvianolic acids, and NBP have no
important impact on neurological deficits or activities of
daily living, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). In addition,

one study demonstrated that tPA plus MTE performed best
(Kaesmacher et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol,
2022 22;13:924747)., 2019), based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Our results indicated that
all tPA, MTE, MTE plus tPA, MTE plus Stent Retrievers,
TQHX plus XM, XST plus XM, and NST plus XM were more
effective for neurological function or activities of daily living
compared with placebo, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Researches have
demonstrated that there was a higher effect of Stent
Retrievers and MTE observed for acute ischemic stroke
than that observed for the mild ischemic stroke patients
(Punal-Rioboo et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747)., 2015), based on the Li Y
et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Similar to
these studies, Stent Retrievers and MTE treatment showed
statistically significant improvement in clinical effect
compared to placebo in our study, based on the Li Y et al.
(Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Research studies
have demonstrated that Human serum albumin has shown
remarkable efficacy in rodent models of ischemic stroke
(Huang and Xiao, 2021), based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Unfortunately, our study
has demonstrated that showing no statistically significant
difference between the albumin and control groups (p > 0,
based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747).05), based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Considering pulmonary
edema and other complications are more likely to occur in
such patients after albumin infusion, the administration of
albumin therapy for acute ischemic stroke should be carried
out with utmost caution, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).
The behavioral symptoms of patients with ischemic
stroke are often evaluated by NFDS/NIHSS/BI/mRS, which
assesses the severity and frequency of neuropsychiatric
symptoms, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). As a result, previous meta-analyses have
reported that the efficacy of blood-activating and stasisdispelling herbs may be related to the severity of ischemic

stroke, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
tPA, MTE, stem cell-based therapies, Stent Retrievers,
Acupuncture, NST, Ginkgo biloba, TQHX, XST, and XNJ show
no serious adverse events in ischemic stroke patients, based
on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).
Our results need to be interpreted with caution to
determine the optimal treatment strategy for ischemic
stroke patients, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol,
2022 22;13:924747).
The effects of tPA may be considerable for ischemic
stroke which is incurable with current treatment
paradigms, and other medications that may slow down the
progression of ischemic stroke patients are worth
exploring, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). Previous studies have showed that tPA or
MTE has beneficial effects on hyperacute period ischemic
stroke (Thelengana et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747)., 2019) (Liu et al, based on
the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747).,
2016), while

22;13:924747). In addition, tPA, MTE plus
tPA, MTE plus Stent Retrievers, blood-activating and stasisdispelling herbs plus XM was reported as only a modest but
significant effect found on behavior in ischemic stroke
patients (Peng et al, based on the Li Y et al. (Front
Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747)., 2014; Punal-Rioboo et al,

(Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747)., 2019), based on
the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). In our
study, Alpha1 was more effective for neurological
improvement rate compared with placebo, based on the Li Y
et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Unfortunately,
the lack of placebo controls in NFDS/NIHSS/BI/mRS score
studies may limit their validity, based on the Li Y et al.
(Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). Interestingly, MSCs
are not significant in mRS score but significant in NIHSS/BI
score, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022
22;13:924747). Moreover, nimodipine can significantly
improve clinical outcomes compared

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our study suggested that tPA, tPA plus MTE, acupuncture plus XM, tPA plus edaravone, and blood-activating

ischemic stroke, based on the Li Y et al. (Front Pharmacol, 2022 22;13:924747). In the future, the combination of welltolerated agents and other significant beneficial treatments should be used for patients with ischemic stroke, which will

decreased risk of stroke.7 8 Dietary factors such as dairy
calcium, high dietary flavonoid intake, fish, soy, nut, tea,
moderate coffee and chocolate consumption may lower
the risk of stroke,9–13 while high salt intake, consumption
of fresh red meat, processed red meat as well as total red
meat and heavy alcohol intake were associated with
increased risk of stroke.14 15 Besides, amount of evidence
was observed for effects on stroke with smoking, overweight, physical activities, depression, long sleep duration
and environmental management.16–20 However, none of
these studies focused on any existing evidence between
modifiable factors and stroke risk systematically. Besides,
though a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses were performed, the methodological quality of
them and quality of evidence remain to be assessed by
validated tools. More importantly, since the general public
increas-ingly focus on prevention through daily self-management, a systematic umbrella review could provide
scientific, instructive and meaningful guidance for them to
some extent.21 Thus, this umbrella review of meta-analyses was conducted to gain a systematic,
comprehensive overview of the existing evidence of cohort
studies on modifiable factors and incidence of stroke and
to assess its strength and validity.

March 2021 for meta--analyses of cohort studies investigating the association between modifiable factors and
stroke risk. Wang X et al. BMJ open. 2022;12(6):e056680
included studies published from database inception
through January 2021. Literature search was conducted by
two authors (XW and ML). Disagreements were resolved
by consensus. In the review, categories of modifiable
factors including dietary factors, factors of physical health
management and emotional health management were
defined a priori. Detailed factors were further confirmed
according to categories in the process. The search strategy
including detailed factors is shown in online supplemental
table S1. Subsequently, Wang X et al. BMJ open.
2022;12(6):e056680 performed a manual search of
reference lists from the retrieved articles. Wang X et al.
BMJ open. 2022;12(6):e056680 also screened the
reference lists of relevant reviews and meta-analyses. No language restric-tion was performed.

Study selection
The criteria for eligibility were: (1) systematic reviews and
meta--analyses of cohort studies on the associations
between modifiable factors and stroke risk in humans with
multivariable adjusted summary risk estimates and
corresponding 95% CIs and (2) studies focusing on the
subtypes of stroke. Wang X et al. BMJ open.

Foods having the correct balance of macronutrients and
micronutrients are the key elements of a healthy diet.66 In
the present review, the protective effects of fruit and
vegetable and their main nutritional ingredi-ents including
vitamin C, flavonoid, potassium and fibre were observed
on stroke. Previous studies demonstrated high intake of
fruit and vegetable could reduce blood pressure.67 As
raised blood pressure was a risk factor, Wang X et al. BMJ
open. 2022;12(6):e056680 speculate the contributions of
Mediterranean diet and food factors above to stroke risk
may be explained by this.68 In the same way, high salt,
processed meat manu-factured with the preservative
sodium nitrate and sodium
intake which are the main risk factor of hypertension and
consequently exerts negative effects on the cardiovascular
systems were associated with increased stroke risk in the
result. The harmful effect of processed meat remained on
ischaemic stroke as a suggestive evidence. Besides, highly
suggestive evidence of chocolate showed as an abundant
source of flavanols, chocolate has benefits for stroke.

which is also a highly suggestive evidence. Specifically,
association between sleep durations and stroke risk was
studied and the result showed long sleepers (>7 hours)
had a higher predicted risk of stroke, which is a highly
suggestive evidence. Although the mechanisms are not
fully understood, it may be explained by increase in some
inflammatory biomarkers and association with carotid
artery atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation.70 71 In
addition, smoking has proven to be associated with
mounts of cardiovascular diseases, even sudden cardiac
death.72 The highly suggestive evidence of smoking on
stroke risk reminds us it is definitely essential to stay away
from smoking, which is the most critical and effective
measure. As an environmental factor accompa-nied by
people’s concern commonly, the role of PM2.5 in stroke was
explored widely. The result showed PM2.5 (per 10 μg/m3
increment) increased the risk of stroke. Although the
accurate mechanisms remain unclear, it could be
explained by the dysfunction of the autonomic system
which is the major pathway that could result in air
pollution--related adverse cardiovascular outcomes, such
as stroke.73 Besides, depression, social isolation and taking
anti-inflammatory drugs also increased stroke risk according to
the present result. Since the evidence of them was weak,
further studies underlying the associations are needed.

CONCLUSION
In summary, evidence indicates that modifiable factors have
an important role in the primary prevention of stroke, based
on the Wang X et al. BMJ open. 2022;12(6):e056680. Diet
with rich macronutrients and micronutri-ents, healthy
dietary patterns as well as favourable phys-ical, emotional
health and environmental management significantly
decrease the risk of stroke, based on the Wang X et al. BMJ
open. 2022;12(6):e056680. These lifestyle modifications
should be promoted in both individual and population
levels to prevent and decrease the burden of stroke in the
future, based on the Wang X et al. BMJ open.
2022;12(6):e056680. Although many modifiable factors
were evaluated in the review, the quality of evidence was
high for a small number of associations, based on the Wang
X et al. BMJ open. 2022;12(6):e056680. To achieve high
quality of evidence for and be able to give strong
recommendation, further studies are needed regarding the
following aspects: studies investigating the associa-tion
between dietary factors and stroke should improve dietary
measurement methods and assess changes in dietary
behaviour over time; potential confounders of stroke are
needed to adjust in the multivariate analysis completely and
more research should focus on the phys-ical, emotional and
environmental health management the evidence of which is
not enough, based on the Wang X et al. BMJ open.

Abstract
Background
Stroke is one of the major challenges for the global healthcare system, which makes it necessary to
explore the relationship between various modifiable factors and stroke risk, based on the Guo Net
al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. Recently, numerous meta-analyses of prospective observational
studies have reported that dietary factors played a key role in the occurrence of stroke, based on the
Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. However, the conclusions of previous studies have
remained controversial and unclear, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194.
Accordingly, Guo Net al, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. BMC medicine,
based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. 2022;20(1):194 conducted an umbrella
review synthesizing and recalculating available evidence to assess the certainty of the associations
between dietary factors and stroke, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194.
Methods
Relevant meta-analyses examining the associations between dietary factors and stroke were
searched in PubMed and Embase databases up to September 1, 2021, based on the Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194. For each eligible meta-analysis, two independent reviewers appraised
the methodologic quality using the AMSTAR 2 criteria and estimated the summary effect size, 95%
confidence intervals, 95% prediction intervals, heterogeneity between studies, and small-study
effects, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. Moreover, Guo Net al, based on the

qualified meta-analyses for qualitative synthesis, involving 71 dietary factors related to food
groups, foods, macronutrients, and micronutrients, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194. Using the AMSTAR 2 criteria, 5 studies were assessed as high quality, 4 studies as
moderate quality, and 113 studies as low or critically low quality, based on the Guo Net al. BMC

BMC medicine, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. 2022;20(1):194 identified
34 dietary factors associated with stroke occurrence, 25 dietary factors related to ischemic stroke,
and 11 factors related to hemorrhagic stroke, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194. Among them, high/moderate certainty epidemiological evidence demonstrated an
inverse association between intake of fruits (RR: 0, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine.

based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194.12), especially processed red meat
consumption (RR:1, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194.17), and stroke
incidence, based on the Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194. Besides, the evidence of
high/moderate certainty suggested that the intake of processed meat, fruits, coffee, tea, magnesium,
and dietary fiber was associated with ischemic stroke risk, while consumption of tea, fruits, and
vegetables was relevant to hemorrhagic stroke susceptibility, based on the Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194.

Background
Stroke, a global health issue, is the major cause of permanent disability and death worldwide,
resulting in a substantial economic burden on individuals, families, and society [1, 2]. With the aging
of the global population, the American Heart Association estimates that the incidence of stroke in
American adults may reach 4% by 2030, causing stroke-related medical expenses rising to $183
billion [3]. Thus, effective prevention and management strategies of stroke are urgently needed in
order to limit the prevalence and cost of stroke. To our knowledge, recent studies have found that
many unmodifiable factors were associated with stroke risk, including age, gender, family history,
and so on [4]. Moreover, modifiable factors also play a vital role in stroke susceptibility.
Dietary factors, an important part of modifiable factors for stroke occurrence, have attracted
intense interest of researchers and clinicians. An increasing number of meta-analyses from
prospective observational studies were conducted to examine the effects of dietary factors on the
risk of stroke. Nevertheless, findings of previous meta-analyses (including the conclusions, strength
of evidence and potential bias, etc.) investigating the association between dietary factors and stroke
susceptibility were sometimes discordant and inconclusive. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of all published meta-analyses to summarize and clarify the
relationship between dietary factors and stroke risk.
An umbrella review, providing a systematic calculation and appraisal of meta-analyses, has been
widely applied to evaluate the association between modifiable factors and disease susceptibility
including dementia [5], multiple sclerosis [6], and various cancers [7, 8], thereby improving the
accuracy and strength of results and revealing the breadth and robustness of associations [9]. Till
now, an umbrella review investigating the association between dietary factors and stroke risk has
not been conducted; hence, in order to further understand and reassess the association, we carried
out a comprehensive umbrella review through collecting all available meta-analyses of prospective
observational studies to explore potential strategies for stroke prevention.

Methods
Literature retrieval strategy
The search strategy of Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 umbrella review adhered to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [10]..
The following search terms Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re applied by searching for
titles and abstracts in PubMed and Embase databases up to September 1, 2021: (“diet” OR “dietary”
OR “intake” OR “consumption”) AND (“stroke” OR “cerebrovascular disease” OR “ischemic stroke”
OR “hemorrhagic stroke” OR “cerebral infarction” OR “brain infarction” OR “cerebral hemorrhage”)
AND (“meta-analysis” OR “systematic review”).. Besides, the reference lists of retrieved articles Guo
Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re carefully screened to search for potentially eligible
articles..
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies that met the following criteria Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re included in Guo
Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 umbrella review: (1) meta-analyses of prospective
observational studies (cohort studies or nested case-control studies) investigating the relationship

intervals (PIs), heterogeneity betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 en studies, and smallstudy effects for further analysis; and (5) published in English.. In contrast, articles Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re excluded based on the following criteria: (1) meta-analyses of nonprospective observational studies, including randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional, or nonnested case-control studies; (2) without original data to analyze the summary risk estimate, 95%

CIs, 95% PIs, etc.. (e..g.., systematic reviews without meta-analysis); (3) reviews, letters, editorials,
and conference abstracts; and (4) duplicated publications..
Data extraction and methodological quality assessment
Two authors respectively collected the following data for each eligible article using a standard
extraction form, including the first author’s name, publication year, study design, original article
retrieval time, dietary factor, outcome of interest (stroke, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke),
number of included studies, number of participants and cases, comparison of types (high versus low
meta-analysis or dose-response meta-analysis), duration of follow-up, assessment tool of the
original study, information of funding, and conflict of interest.. Moreover, Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 extracted the most fully adjusted effect estimates and corresponding 95% CIs from
original studies.. According to the literature, the most important adjustment factors in the
investigation betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 en dietary factors and stroke
susceptibility included age, gender, body mass index, physical activity, total energy intake, smoking,
hypertension, and diabetes mellitus..
The AMSTAR (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) 2, a reliable methodological
quality assessment tool, was applied to evaluate the quality of each eligible meta-analyses [11].. It
was composed of 16 items, which Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re divided into 7
critical and 9 non-critical domains.. According to the quality of each item, including search strategy,
study selection, data extraction, study limitations, risk of bias assessment, etc.., Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 further categorized each systematic review into high, moderate, low, or
critical low quality..
Statistical analysis
In this umbrella review, the random and fixed effect models Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 re applied to calculate the summary effect size and 95% CIs to assess the
association betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 en dietary factors and stroke risk.. Guo
Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 further computed the 95% PIs, which represented the
probability range in which the effect estimates from future studies investigating the same
association would lie with 95% certainty [12].. Then, the Cochran Q test and I2 statistic Guo Net al.
BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re also performed to analyze the statistical heterogeneity betGuo

BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re deemed to be high heterogeneity.. Moreover, Egger’s test and
funnel plot Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re applied to evaluate the small-study effect
and publication bias for each eligible meta-analysis by using statistical and graphical tests.. The
results of P value < 0..10 Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re considered to be significant
evidence of small-study effects.. Lastly, Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 carried out
subgroup evaluation according to stroke subtypes, namely ischemic stroke and hemorrhage stroke..
All statistical analyses Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re conducted using STATA
software 12..0.. Apart from heterogeneity and small-study effects, all tests Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re considered to be significant at the level of P value < 0..05..
Credibility of epidemiologic evidence
In accordance with established tools applied in previous umbrella reviews, Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 appraised the strength of epidemiologic evidence for the relationship
betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 en each dietary factor and stroke risk by using the
following criteria: (1) precision of the estimate (P value < 0..001, a threshold with less false-positive
possibility); (2) number of cases > 1000; (3) no significance heterogeneity (Pheterogeneity > 0..10
and I2 < 50%); and (4) no evidence of small-study effect (PEgger > 0..10).. Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 quantified the epidemiologic evidence as high credibility (if all the above
criteria Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re met), moderate credibility (if P value < 0..001
was found and two of the remaining three criteria Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re

included meta-analyses per dietary factor was 3 (range 1–12).. Besides, the evidence of each metaanalysis was based on median 7 original studies (interquartile range 4–10, range 2–40), median
253,511 participants (interquartile range 173,274–354,718, range 20,089–4,381,604), and median
6978 stroke cases (interquartile range 4260–10,192, range 299–46,951)..
If more than one meta-analysis Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re available to assess the
same dietary factor, the one with dose-response analysis was selected in the main analysis.. Then,
when more than one published dose-response meta-analysis for the same association, the one with
the largest number of participants was preferred.. Thus, the main analysis for dietary factors
retained 71 risk estimates, including 40 food groups, foods, and beverages and 31 macronutrients
and micronutrients.. Moreover, of the 71 dietary factors, 41 dose-response relationships Guo Net al.
BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re available, among which 31 provided the information of the
linearity of the dose-response relationships (e..g.., P for non-linearity).. Five of these 31 doseresponse relationships indicated non-linearity, including vegetables, red meat, nut, vitamin E, and
magnesium.. Additionally, in the main analysis based on stroke subtypes, 44 risk estimates Guo Net
al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re retained to analyze the association betGuo Net al. BMC

the influence of dietary factors on hemorrhagic stroke..
Methodological quality assessment of meta-analyses
The meta-analyses included in Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 umbrella review Guo Net
al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re assessed for methodological quality, with 5 studies being
considered as high (4..10%), 4 studies as moderate (3..28%), and 113 studies as low (43 studies,
35..25%) or critically low (70 studies, 57..38%) (see Additional file 4: Table S4).. The common
critical flaws in most meta-analyses Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re the lack of
information of registered protocols (110 studies, 90..16%).. Thus, Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 conducted a sensitivity analysis, which did not consider the item of a registered
protocol, to re-analyze the methodological quality of eligible studies.. The results of sensitivity
analysis shoGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 d that the AMSTAR 2 rating was redetermined as high in 14 studies (11..48%), moderate in 37 studies (30..33%), and low (35 studies,
28..69%) or critically low (36 studies, 29..51%) in 71 studies (see Additional file 5: Table S5)..
Quantitative analysis on 40 food groups, foods, and beverages
As shown in Fig.. Fig..2,2, the summary effect size with its corresponding 95% CI was calculated to
report the associations betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 en food groups, foods,

Next, Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 conducted a stratified evaluation according to the
type of stroke.. For ischemic stroke, the results of meta-analyses indicated that consumption of
grain foods (RR: 0..86, 95% CI: 0..74–0..99) [14], fruits and vegetables (RR: 0..94, 95% CI: 0..90–

0..98) [25], dairy products (RR: 0..79, 95% CI: 0..68–0..91) [131], and chocolate (RR: 0..87, 95% CI:
0..78–0..96) had a protective effect on ischemic stroke [73], while the consumption of meat
increased the risk of ischemic stroke (RR: 1..15, 95% CI: 1..04–1..28) [35, 37, 39].. Besides, the
consumption of fish (HR: 0..96, 95% CI: 0..89–1..03) [28], eggs (RR: 0..94, 95% CI: 0..88–1..00) [40],
and legumes (RR: 1..06, 95% CI: 0..74–1..50) [48] was not related to the risk of ischemic stroke (Fig..
(Fig..3)..3).. Regarding hemorrhagic stroke, the reduction of hemorrhagic stroke risk was related to
the consumption of fruits and vegetables (RR: 0..78, 95% CI: 0..69–0..88) [23], fish (HR: 0..88, 95%
CI: 0..80–0..96) [28], dairy products (RR: 0..75, 95% CI: 0..60–0..94) [131], and chocolate (RR: 0..83,
95% CI: 0..71–0..97) [73] and the increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke was associated with meat
consumption (RR: 1..41, 95% CI: 1..08–1..84) [34].. In addition, no associations Guo Net al. BMC

stroke (RR: 0..80, 95% CI: 0..71–0..90), but not from hemorrhagic stroke (RR: 1..03, 95% CI: 0..68–
1..57) [78, 79].. Additionally, dose-response evidence suggested that tea consumption (per cup per
day) protected against stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke (stroke: RR: 0..96, 95% CI:
0..94-0..99; ischemic stroke: RR: 0..76, 95% CI: 0..69–0..84; hemorrhagic stroke: RR: 0..79, 95% CI:

In further stratified evaluation based on stroke type (Figs.. (Figs..66 and and7),7), Guo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 observed that n-3 PUFA and SFA intake could significantly reduce the
risk of ischemic stroke (n-3 PUFA: RR: 0..87, 95% CI: 0..76–0..99; SFA: RR: 0..89, 95% CI: 0..82–0..96)

stroke (RR: 0..85, 95% CI: 0..79–0..91), while failed to reach significance in hemorrhagic stroke (RR:
0..87, 95% CI: 0..72–1..05) [99, 134].. In addition, no statistically significant evidence was found to

Micronutrients
According to the meta-analyses of prospective observational studies, several dietary
micronutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and flavonoids, Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 re associated with stroke risk.. As displayed in Fig.. Fig..5,5, dietary intake of
vitamin B6 (RR: 0..94, 95% CI: 0..89–0..99) [102], folic acid (RR: 0..94, 95% CI: 0..90–0..98) [102],

[127] had a significant impact on decreasing the occurrence of stroke.. Conversely, sodium intake
had a significant effect on increasing stroke risk (RR: 1..10, 95% CI: 1..01–1..19) with evidence of a
linear dose-response relationship [125].. Additionally, no clear associations Guo Net al. BMC

Discussion
Principal findings
In Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 umbrella review, a total of 122 eligible meta-analyses
Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re included to assess the impact of 71 dietary factors on
stroke, including 40 foods, food groups, and beverages and 31 macronutrients and micronutrients.
After assessing the credibility of all included meta-analyses using stringent criteria, the evidence
strength for fruits, vegetables, and red meat was considered as high/moderate, indicating that they
may have an important impact on stroke prevention. Among them, the intake of fruits and
vegetables was observed to reduce the risk of stroke, while the consumption of red meat, especially
processed red meat, was considered to increase the risk.
Possible explanations
Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 umbrella review indicated that high consumption of
fruits and vegetables was beneficial to the general population for preventing stroke. This protective
effect can be attributed to the various nutrients contained in fruits and vegetables, including
vitamin C, potassium, dietary fiber, and flavonoids [22]. First, vitamin C, a poGuo Net al. BMC
medicine. 2022;20(1):194 rful water-soluble antioxidant, has been suggested to inhibit low-density
lipoprotein peroxidation and smooth muscle hyperplasia/hypertrophy, thereby retarding the
formation of atherosclerosis [103, 136, 137]. Second, potassium has been found to have an impact
on the development of stroke. Increased potassium levels would relax blood vessels and inhibit
excessive activation of platelets. Moreover, a high-potassium diet could significantly delay the
development of vascular damage by restraining the production of reactive oxygen species [122,
138]. Third, the consumption of dietary fiber can slow down gastric emptying, promote satiety,
reduce absorption of food, and thus reduce body overGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194
ight and blood lipid levels [101, 139, 140]. As secondary metabolites of polyphenols, flavonoids can
inhibit LDL oxidation and vascular inflammation and play an important role in protecting
endothelial function [141–143].
Additionally, it is also biologically reasonable that high consumption of red meat could increase the
risk of stroke. First of all, high red meat intake could increase the circulating levels of LDL-C and
triglycerides, which might cause atherosclerotic plaques, interrupt blood flow to the brain, and lead
to stroke occurrence [34]. Then, heme iron, mainly derived from red meat, is a redox active
substance that could promote the production of oxygen free radicals, leading to LDL-C peroxidation
and subsequent vascular inflammation and damage [144–146]. Moreover, processed meat usually
contains high levels of sodium and nitrite preservatives [124]. High sodium levels could reduce
arterial compliance, cause vascular stiffness, and thus have a negative impact on subsequent high
blood pressure and stroke [147, 148]. The cytotoxicity of nitrite preservatives can induce vascular
endothelium damage and apoptosis, which is a critical driving factor for endothelial dysfunction
[149].
Subgroup evaluation
Regarding ischemic stroke, the evidence of high/moderate certainty indicated that the intake of
coffee, tea, magnesium, fruits, dietary fiber, and processed meat was associated with ischemic
stroke risk. From a biological point of view, caffeine, a famous ingredient in coffee, plays a vital role
in reducing oxidation stress and inflammatory response and delaying atherosclerosis progression
[150]. Moreover, the chlorogenic acid contained in coffee can regulate the body’s glucose and lipid
metabolism and inhibit the activation of platelets [78]. As for tea, flavonoids in tea can induce
vasodilation and improve cerebral blood perfusion by activating nitric oxide [151, 152]. Meanwhile,
tea contains a high concentration of theanine, which can pass through the blood-brain barrier and
reduce glutamate-related vascular endothelial damage [84]. Regarding micronutrients, magnesium
has been shown to be associated with ischemic stroke, which could be explained by the following

reasons. As a natural calcium antagonist, magnesium could inhabit the influx of glutamate and
calcium cations and eliminate the cytotoxicity of calcium cations [111]. Moreover, a previous study
shoGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 d that magnesium deficiency was related to vascular
dysfunction and platelet-dependent thrombosis [153]. Besides, magnesium intake also plays a vital
role in loGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 ring blood sugar and blood pressure levels
[154].
With regard to hemorrhagic stroke, Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 found more
associations for ischemic stroke than hemorrhagic stroke. The possible reasons may be as follows:
the etiology of ischemic stroke, including oxidative stress, free radical production, lipid
peroxidation, and vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis, is more closely related to nutritional
factors [155, 156]. More importantly, the incidence of ischemic stroke is much higher than that of
hemorrhagic stroke, so it receives more attention from researchers. Thus, more original studies
should be performed to investigate the relationship betGuo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194
en dietary factors and hemorrhagic stroke.
Strengths and limitations
To the best of Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 knowledge, Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 umbrella review was the first to systematically collect and evaluate all published
meta-analyses and summarize the evidence on the role of dietary factors in preventing stroke. Guo
Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 have included only meta-analyses focusing on prospective
observational studies, which collected exposure information before stroke diagnosis and reduced
recall bias compared to retrospective studies. Meanwhile, robust criteria Guo Net al. BMC medicine.
2022;20(1):194 re adopted to assess the methodologic quality and evidence strength of eligible
meta-analyses. Moreover, Guo Net al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 highlighted the doseresponse relationship, subgroup evaluation, sensitivity analysis, and biological plausibility to obtain
a more comprehensive and accurate conclusion for each dietary factor.
Several limitations of this umbrella review should also be recognized. First, the individual
observational study may have a different definition and measurement method for exposure
comparison, which makes it impossible to determine the exact comparison for the included metaanalyses. Second, within an observational design, the original studies in the meta-analysis Guo Net
al. BMC medicine. 2022;20(1):194 re prone to confounding bias. Thus, some known confounders

Abstract:

Objective: Although various predictive instruments have been introduced for early stroke diagnosis, there is no
consensus on their performance, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. Therefore, Baratloo A et al,
based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. Front Emer Med, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med.

2022. 2022 decided to assess the value of predictive instruments in the de-tection of stroke by conducting an umbrella
review, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022.
Method: A search was performed in the Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science databases by the end of August
2021 for systematic reviews and meta-analyses, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. Original
articles included in the systematic reviews were retrieved, summarized and pooled sensitivity, specificity and
diagnostic odds ratio were calculated, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. The level of evidence was
divided into five groups: convincing (class I), highly suggestive (class II), suggestive (class III), weak (class IV) and
non-significant, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022.
Results: The value of 33 predictive instruments was evaluated, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022.
The sample size included in these scoring sys-tems’ assessments varied between 182 and 47072 patients, based on
the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. The level of evidence was class I in one tool, class II in 18 tools, class III in
2 tools, class IV in 11 tools, and non-significant in one tool, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022.
Apart from Med PACS, which had a low diagnostic value, other tools appeared to be able to detect a stroke, based on
the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. The optimum performance for diagnosis of stroke was for ROSIER, NIHSS,
PASS, FAST, LAMS, RACE and CPSS, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022.
Conclusion: Convincing to suggestive evidence shows that ROSIER, NIHSS, PASS, FAST, LAMS, RACE and CPSS have
the optimum performance in identifying stroke, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022. Since ROSIER’s
calculation is simple and has the high-est sensitivity and specificity among those predictive instruments, it is
recommended for stroke diagnosis in pre-hospital and in-hospital settings, based on the Baratloo A et al. Front Emer
Med. 2022.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the main causes of mortality and morbidity
with an annual incidence rate of 25 million cases (1). Stroke is
one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide (1, 2) and is the
cause of 5 to 10 percent of acute deaths. Based on the
responsible pathophysiological processes, stroke is di-vided
into two types: hemorrhagic and ischemic. The preva-lence of
ischemic stroke is much higher than the hemor-rhagic type;
However, mortality due to hemorrhagic stroke is much higher
than the ischemic type (1).
The most well-known treatment for ischemic stroke is the use
of intravenous thrombolytics such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), which should be administrated in 3.5 to 4 hours
after the onset of stroke symptoms (3). Another treatment
mentioned in recent studies is thrombectomy. Endovascu-

lar thrombectomy in great vessels is one of the most effec-tive
treatments for ischemic stroke (4-6). While surgery and
endovascular embolization are used to treat strokes, the effectiveness of these treatments could be reduced in many cases
due to delayed diagnosis. If the response team is able to quickly
diagnose cerebrovascular accidents, the onset-to-door time
could be substantially decreased.
Computed tomography scan (CT scan) and magnetic reso-nance
imaging (MRI) are reliable modalities to detect strokes (7), but
the lack of access to these imaging techniques in pre-hospital
settings and even in some hospitals has led re-searchers to look
for other alternatives.
One of these alternative methods is using clinical screening tools.
Various predictive instruments have been introduced to detect
stroke, such as the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Severity Scale
(CPSS); Los Angeles Motor Scale (LAMS); National In-

stitutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS); Rapid Arterial Occlusion Evaluation; the Stroke Vision, Aphasia, Neglect assess-ment
(VAN); Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Screen (MASS); Medic
Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (Med PACS); Ontario
Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSS); Recogni-tion of
Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) and Face Arm Speech
Test (FAST) (8-11). Several systematic reviews have evaluated
the value of these tools in stroke diagno-sis, but there are
substantial differences in their conclusions. Some believe that
the value of these predictive instruments is equivalent in the
diagnosis of stroke, but others do not have such an opinion (8,
10). Therefore, Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022 decided
to assess the value of predictive instruments in stroke detection
by con-ducting an umbrella review to find the optimum
diagnostic tools for early stroke detection.

2. Methods
2.1. Study design
The protocol of the present study has been registered and approved by Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The university ethics committee oversaw the study process. In the
present study, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations (12)
and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines (13) were used. All steps of search-ing,
screening and summarizing the articles were performed by at
least two independent researchers and any disagree-ments
were resolved by discussion with a third researcher.

2.2. Search strategy
The purpose of this umbrella review is to compare the value of
scoring systems in identifying stroke. For this purpose, an
extensive search was initially conducted in the electronic resources of Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science by the
end of August 2021. Then, with the appropriate combi-nation of
keywords related to stroke and predictive instru-ments,
systematic reviews and meta-analyses were searched. The full
search strategies for these databases have been re-ported in
Appendix 1. PICO definition of the present study is as follows:
diagnostic value of clinical decision rules (I) in stroke diagnosis
(P). Comparisons (C) were done with a gold standard modality
(CT scan and/or MRI) and the outcome (O) was considered the
diagnostic value of these tools in de-tection of stroke. In
addition to the systematic search, a man-ual search was also
performed on Google search engine, and Google scholar.
Articles were screened based on title and abstract and systematic reviews and meta-analyses were studied in full text
subsequently. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews and
meta-analysis that were conducted to assess the diagnostic
value of scoring systems in identifying strokes. Exclusion criteria included studies with a pediatric population, narrative
reviews, non-stoke studies, radiology-based decision tools and
non-diagnostic reviews.

Baratloo et al.

2.3. Data extraction
Data collection and summarization were performed by at least
two independent researchers. Following the acquisi-tion of the
full text of systematic review and meta-analysis articles,
information related to the name of the first author, year of
publication, number of articles included in the sys-tematic
review/meta-analysis, samples’ size and setting of study (inhospital or pre-hospital) were recorded. Since in some cases,
systematic reviews and meta-analyses included identical
articles and some eligible reviews did not report pooled results,
it was decided to obtain the full text of in-cluded original
articles and extract the required data from them. FBaratloo A et
al. Front Emer Med. 2022 independent researchers attained the
papers and extracted the required data. If a study stratified the
analysis by different subgroups, Baratloo A et al. Front Emer
Med. 2022 also recorded the findings separately. In some studies, the diagnostic value of several predictive instruments was examined and therefore, the data were
recorded separately for each tool. The quality of the methodology of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was assessed
using AMSTAR (A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) version 2 (14).

2.4. Data synthesis, certainty of evidence and
statistical analyses
In the present umbrella review, True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negative (FN) val-ues
were extracted from the articles. If the values of TP , TN, FP and
FN were not reported, these values were calculated based on
sensitivity, specificity and sample size. Since most of the review
articles reported only sensitivity and specificity, all the original
studies included in these review articles were investigated and
data were extracted as required. Data were entered only once if
a study was reported in two or more sys-tematic reviews.
For each tool a sensitivity, specificity, Diagnostic Odds Ratio
(DOR), Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) and Negative Likeli-hood
Ratio (NLR) were calculated. The “metandi” package in STATA
17.0 statistical software was used to calculate the Since this
package is only able to perform analy-values.
ses in cases where there are at least 4 articles, in cases that the
number of imported original articles was less than 4, the“meta”
package was used to report pooled effect size. For this purpose,
the values of sensitivity, specificity, DOR, PLR and NLR and its
95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calcu-lated and then
the analyses were pooled with the meta com-mand.
Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the
I2statistics and I2above 50% was considered as hetero-geneity.
Deek’s asymmetry plot was used to examine the pub-lication
bias and small-study effect. Excess significance bias was also
investigated using the method proposed by Ioanni-dis and
Trikalinos (15) and p <0.05 indicated excess signifi-cant bias.
Level of evidence was assessed based on the method pro-posed
in the previous article (16). Since DOR is a represen-tative value
for sensitivity and specificity, it was used for as-

sessment of certainty of evidence. The level of evidence was
divided into fBaratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022 groups:
convincing (class I), highly sugges-tive (class II), suggestive
(class III), weak (class IV) and non-significant. Convincing level
of evidence was in cases where the sample size was more than
1000 patients, p value ob-tained for pooled DOR in random
effect model was less than 10-6, no evidence of heterogeneity
was present (I2<50%), prediction interval did not cross the null
and no evidence of small-study effect and excess significance
was present. Highly suggestive level was in cases where the
sample size was more than 1000 patients, random effect p value
for ef-fect size was lower than 10−6, the largest included study
had a significant effect whilst class I criteria were not met. The
level of evidence was suggestive when the sample size was
more than 1000 patients, p value of random effect model was
lower than 10−3, the largest included study had a significant
effect whilst class I-II criteria were not met. The level of evidence was poor when the p value was <0.05 and no Class I-III
criteria were met. Finally, non-significant was reported when
the p value of effect size was higher than 0.05. This approach
has been done based on the previous umbrella review (16).

the evaluation of 9 tools was less than 1000 patients. Ex-cept
for the Vision, Aphasia, Neglect (VAN) scale and Med PACS,
significant DOR for stroke was observed in studied pre-dictive
instruments. Out of 33 analyses, the p-value for 28 tools
(82.86%) was less than 10−6. Significant heterogene-ity was
observed in 51.51% of the analyses. Prediction inter-val in
24.24% of the analyses included null. In three scoring systems
(9.09%) evidence of small study effect and 5 analy-ses
(15.15%) evidence of excess significant bias was observed
(Tables 5 and 6). In general, the level of evidence was class I in
1 tool, class II in 18 tools, class III in 2 tools, class IV in 11 tools
and non-significant in 1 tool. All tools reported in at least 4
studies were class I-III (Tables 5 and 6).

3.3. Diagnostic performance of clinical instruments that have been reported in at least 4 studies
The level of evidence of predictive instruments reported in at
least 4 studies was between classes I-III. There was no class IV
in this group. Therefore, the evidence obtained is between
convincing to suggestive. Level of evidence of Balance, Eyes,
Face, Arm, Speech, Time (BE-FAST) tools was also in class I and
the sensitivity and specificity of this clinical tool were

Based on the number of articles included in each clinical as-studies
sessment tool, the analyses were performed in two parts. A)
predictive instruments that at least 4 articles have examined
their diagnostic value in identifying stroke (Table 3) and B)
predictive instruments that less than 4 studies have exam-ined
their diagnostic value (Table 4).
The number of people included in the diagnostic value of
scoring systems varied between 182 and 47072 patients. The
largest sample sizes were related to NIHSS, CPSS, Rapid Arterial

4. Discussion
Based on Baratloo A et al. Front Emer Med. 2022 knowledge,
this study is the first umbrella re-view performed on the value
of predictive instruments in stroke diagnosis. In the present
study, 33 scoring systems were examined and the evidence
obtained for 21 tools were in class I-III. Apart from Med PACS,
whose DOR was non-significant for stroke diagnosis, other tools
appear to be able to detect a stroke.
Among these tools, the
optimum per-

formance was seen for ROSIER, NIHSS, PASS, FAST, LAMS, RACE
and CPSS. Although the highest sensitivity and speci-ficity in
stroke diagnosis belonged to ACT-FAST, the number of studies
included in the assessment of this clinical tool was two (sample
size 1130), pointing to a need for further com-prehensive
studies.
ROSIER tool consists of 7 variables including the level of

much easier to calculate than NIHSS. The NIHSS is an 11domain tool that is time-consuming to evaluate. The current
umbrella review demonstrates that ROSIER performance is
better than all NIHSS versions (full and abbreviated version)
and may be used as an effective tool in emergency settings to

the studies. Since in Ioannidis and Trikalinos method (15), the
power is calculated based on the effect size of the largest study
and regarding the fact that the sample size was very high in
these studies, the expected number of significant studies was
very similar to the observed number of signif-icant studies.
Nevertheless, the Cochrane guideline states

In the present study, there was no evidence of excess significance bias present. Since in all included tools, the largest

There was significant heterogeneity among the included studies

Abstract
Background: The literature on endovascular treatment (EVT) for large-vessel occlusion (LVO)
acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) has been rapidly increasing after the publication of positive
randomized-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and a plethora of systematic reviews (SRs)
showing benefit compared to best medical therapy (BMT) for LVO.
Objectives: An overview of SRs (umbrella review) and meta-analysis of primary RCTs were
performed to summarize the literature and present efficacy and safety of EVT.
Design and methods: MEDLINE via Pubmed, Embase and Epistemonikos databases were
searched from January 2015 until 15 October 2023. All SRs of RCTs comparing EVT to BMT were
included. Quality was assessed using Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews scores and the RoB 2
Cochrane Collaboration tool, as appropriate. GRADE approach was used to evaluate the strength of
evidence. Data were presented according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of
Reviews statement. The primary outcome was 3-month good functional outcome [modified Rankin
scale (mRS) score 0–2].
Results: Three eligible SRs and 4 additional RCTs were included in the overview, comprising a
total of 24 RCTs, corresponding to 5968 AIS patients with LVO (3044 randomized to EVT versus
2924 patients randomized to BMT). High-quality evidence shows that EVT is associated with an
increased likelihood of good functional outcome [risk ratio (RR) 1.78 (95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.54–2.06); 166 more per 1000 patients], independent ambulation [mRS-scores 0–3; RR 1.50
(95% CI: 1.37–1.64); 174 more per 1000 patients], excellent functional outcome [mRS-scores 0–1;
RR 1.90 (95% CI: 1.62–2.22); 118 more per 1000 patients] at 3 months. EVT was associated with
reduced 3-month mortality [RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74–0.88); 61 less per 1000 patients] despite an
increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage [sICH; RR 1.65 (95% CI: 1.23–2.21); 22 more
per 1000 patients].
Conclusion: In patients with AIS due to LVO in the anterior or posterior circulation, within 24 h
from symptom onset, EVT improves functional outcomes and increases the chance of survival
despite increased sICH risk.
